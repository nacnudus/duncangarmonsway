## Reading week

This week I am reading [Statistical
Rethinking](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-Stan/McElreath/p/book/9781482253443)
by Richard McElreath.  Each day I post my prior beliefs about Bayesian
Statistics, read a bit, and update them.  See also [Day

## Prior beliefs

* At stats conferences, people arrive in 1.1s and 2.2s.
* Exactly 3 things will happen about 19.5 percent of the time, and now you've
  lost your audience.
* I *can* draw a line between integers and what's more I'm going to.
* Theoretically `factor(ordered = TRUE)` has a purpose but it has yet to be
  observed in nature.
* Zero-inflated outcomes are modelled by fitting a Bernoulli to "is it zero?" and
  handling non-zeros entirely separately.
* Over-dispersion is like when the lid of a plastic container has stretched and
  only one corner fits at a time, so you hold it down with elastic bands,
  double-bag it and try to keep it upright.  In other words none of the standard
  distributions fit and nobody can be bothered to invent one that does.
* Multilevel models are what Gelman says you should do instead of whatever you
  are doing because mumble mumble *p*-values and they retain more degrees of
  freedom or something.
* For some reason 'multilevel' is nothing to do with 'deep'.

## New data

### 10. Counting and Classification

* "No one has ever observed a proportion."
* "The fundamental friction of passing between count data and inference about
  proportion never fades"

#### 10.1 Binomial regression

I found the chimpanzee example rather bewildering -- the first such moment so
far.  It has been completely rewritten in the draft 2nd Edition, but this series
is about the 1st Edition.  Also the redraft still uses `pulled_left` as the
outcome variable, so my query about that still stands.

* "you can get a sense of ... how often MAP estimation works, even when in
  principle it should not"
* "The outcome `pulled_left` is a 0 or 1 indicator that the focal animal pulled
  the left-hand lever."  *Why not `pulled_prosocial` -- hasn't
  left/right-handedness been randomised away?  I think this has resulted in a
  confusing Figure 10.2*
* "Think of handedness here as a masking variable."
* "The only reason the posterior distribution falls off at all is because we
  used a weak regularizing prior in the model definition."
* "just inspecting the posterior distribution alone would never have revealed
  that fact to us.  We had to appeal to something outside the fit model."
* "a male in this sample has about 90% the odds of admission as a female,
  comparing within departments" *This is presented as the classic example of
  Simpson's Paradox, so I'm surprised it concludes summary statistic across all
  departments*.
* "remain skeptical of models and try to imagine ways they might be deceiving
  us."
* "At large log-odds, almost any value is just about as good as any other. So
  the uncertainty is asymmetric and the flat prior does nothing to calm
  inference down on the high end of it. The estimates above, read naively,
  suggest that there is no association between `y` and `x`, even though they are
  strongly associated."

#### 10.2 Poisson regression

* "Suppose for example that you come to own, through imperial drama, another
  monastery."
* "how could  you analyze both [sets of records] in the same model, given that
  the counts are aggregated over different amounts of time, different
  exposures?" *What follows is a neat trick.*
* "even HMC is going to be less efficient, when there are strong correlations in
  the posterior distribution."
* "centering predictors can aid in inference, by reducing correlations among
  parameters."

#### 10.3 Other count regressions

* "In a multinomial (or categorical) GLM, you need $K - 1$ linear models for $K$
  types of events."
* "the estimates swing around wildly, depending upon which event type you assign
  a constant score."
* "It's usually computationally easier to use Poisson rather than multinomial
  likelihoods." *i.e. rates rather than probabilities*
* "I appreciate that this kind of thing -- modeling the same data different ways
  but getting the same inferences -- is exactly the kind of thing that makes
  statistics maddening for scientists."
* "if there are *k* event types, you can model multinomial probabilities ...
  using Poisson rate parameters ... And you can recover the multinomial
  probabilities"

### 11. Monsters and Mixtures

* "if you ever need to construct your own unique monster, feel free to do so."

#### 11.1 Ordered categorical outcomes

* "It is very common in the social sciences ..."
* "we'd like ... to move predictions progressively through the categories in
  sequence."
* "By linking a linear model to cumulative probability, it is possible to
  guarantee the ordering of the outcomes."
* Figure 11.1 connects integers by lines.
* "Since the largest response value always has a cumulative probability of 1, we
  effectively do not need a parameter for it."
* "in small sample contexts, you'll have to think much harder about priors.
  Consider for example that we know $\alpha_1 \lt \alpha_2$, before we even see
  the data."
* "if we decrease the log-cumulative-odds of every outcome value *k* below the
  maximum, this necessarily shifts probability mass upwards towards higher
  outcome variables ... an increase in the predictor variable *x* results in an
  increase in the average response."
* "With power comes hardship."

#### 11.2 Zero-inflated outcomes

* **Now you can imagine your own generative process, simulate data from it, write the
  model, and verify that it recovers the true parameter values.  You don't have
  to wait for a mathematician to legalize the model you need.**
* "To get this model going, we need to define a likelihood function that mixes
  these two processes." *In this example, logit and Poisson*.

#### 11.3 Over-dispersed outcomes

* "For a counting process like a binomial, the variance is a function of the
  same parameters as the expected value ... When the observed variance exceeds
  this amount ... this implies that some omitted variable is producing
  additional dispersion in the observed counts."
* "Even when no additional variables are available, it is possible to mitigate
  the effects of over-dispersion."
* "it is often easier to use multilevel models in place of beta-binomial and
  gamma-Poisson GLMs."
* "This distribution is described using a beta distribution, which is a
  probability distribution for probabilities" *??*
* "The model can't see departments, because we didn't tell it about them. But it
  does see heterogeneity across rows." *This seems a touch disingenuous, because
  the reason there are rows is because the data were collected
  one-row-per-department, so we might as well have told the model about
  departments.  I can't conceive of when you would have rows of data but no
  variable to include in the model.*
* "Models for over-dispersion ... draw the expected value of each observation
  from a distribution that changes shape as a function of a linear model."

### 12. Multilevel Models

* "Any of the models from previous chapters that used dummy variables to handle
  categories are programmed for amnesia."
* "It is better to begin to build a multilevel analysis, and then realize it's
  unnecessary, than to overlook it."
* "it becomes much easier to incorporate related tricks such as allowing for
  measurement error int he data and even modelling missing data itself."

#### 12.1 Example: Multilevel tadpoles

* "Take a look at the full paper, if amphibian life history dynamics interests
  you."
* "This is a regularizing prior, like you've used in previous chapters, but now
  the amount of regularization has been learned from the data itself."
* "Ordinary MAP estimation cannot handle the averaging in the likelihood,
  because in general it's not possible to derive an analytical solution."
* "We really need to give up on optimization as a strategy."
* "Shrinkage is stronger, the further a tank's empirical proportion is from the
  global average $\alpha$."
* "Compared to a beta-binomial or gamma-Poisson model, a binomial or Poisson
  model with varying intercept on every observed outcome will often be easier to
  estimate and easier to extend."
* "if you only have 5 clusters, then that's something like trying to estimate a
  variance with 5 data points."
* "it is typically useful to try different priors to ensure that inference
  either is insensitive to them or rather to measure how inference is altered."

#### 12.2 Varying effects and the underfitting/overfitting trade-off

I came totally unstuck here, and it's the same in the draft 2nd Edition, so
please chip in if you think you can help.  It's the first time I've found the
Bayesian method harder to follow than the frequentist.

In the previous multilevel model in 12.1 we "adaptively learn the prior that is
common to all of these intercepts."  The model is:

$$
\begin{align}
s_i & \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
\mathrm{logit}(p_i) & = \alpha_{\small{TANK}[i]} \\
\alpha_{\small{TANK}} & \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 5)
\end{align}
$$

In this section, the varying effects model renames TANK to POND, and puts
priors on the parameters of $\alpha_{\small{POND}}$:

$$
\begin{align}
s_i & \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
\mathrm{logit}(p_i) & = \alpha_{\small{POND}[i]} \\
\alpha_{\small{POND}} & \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\alpha, \sigma) \\
\alpha & \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma & \sim \mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 1)
\end{align}
$$

But in the end, isn't $\alpha_{\small{POND}}$ still a vector drawn from a single
normal prior?  What was the point of putting priors on the prior?

Regardless of my lack of understand, a couple of useful quotes:

* "When individual ponds are very large, pooling in this way does hardly
  anything to improve estimates"
* "This is a form of regularization ... but now with an amount of regularization
  that is learned from the data itself."
* "sometimes outliers really are outliers"

#### 12.3 More than one type of cluster

* "There may be unique intercepts for each actor as well as for each block."
* "It's conventional to define varying intercepts with a mean of zero, so
  there's no risk of accidentally creating hard-to-identify parameters."
* "As soon as you start trusting the machine, the machine will betray your
  trust."
* "There is nothing to gain here by selecting either model.  The comparison of
  the two models tells a richer story"
* "If you have a good theoretical reason to include a cluster variable, then you
  also have good theoretical reason to partially pool its parameters."

#### 12.4 Multilevel posterior predictions

* "Every model is a merger of sense and nonsense."
* "You have to expect that even a perfectly good model fit will differ from the
  raw data in a systematic way that reflects shrinkage."
* "the estimates should not necessarily match up with the raw data, once you use
  pooling"
* "the uncertainty [about the population mean] is much smaller than it really
  should be, if we wish to honestly represent the problem of what to expect from
  a new individual"
* "To show the variation among actors, we'll need to use `sigma_actor` in the
  calculation."
* "The predictions for an average actor help to visualize the impact of
  treatment."
* "They hyper-parameters tell us how to forecast a new cluster, by generating a
  distribution of new per-cluster intercepts."

## Updated beliefs

* ✕ At stats conferences, people arrive in 1.1s and 2.2s. *There are reasonable
  ways to deal with this.
* ✓ Exactly 3 things will happen about 19.5 percent of the time, and now you've
  lost your audience. *I still find it hard to make decisions based on posterior
  estimates of counts*.
* ✓ I *can* draw a line between integers and what's more I'm going to. *It's right there in the book!*.
* ✕ Theoretically `factor(ordered = TRUE)` has a purpose but it has yet to be
  observed in nature. *Likert scales.*
* ✓ Zero-inflated outcomes are modelled by fitting a Bernoulli to "is it zero?" and
  handling non-zeros entirely separately. *This is not something Bayes does differently, it just has better machinery for it.*
* ✓ Over-dispersion is like when the lid of a plastic container has stretched and
	only one corner fits at a time, so you hold it down with elastic bands,
  double-bag it and try to keep it upright.  In other words none of the standard
  distributions fit and nobody can be bothered to invent one that does.
  *McElreath's geocentric analogy is so apt -- when a model doesn't fit, add a
  model to the model.*
* ✕ Multilevel models are what Gelman says you should do instead of whatever you
	are doing because mumble mumble *p*-values and they retain more degrees of
  freedom or something. *Wrong again. I don't know where I got this impression.
  Perhaps it's a frequentist thing.*
* ✓ For some reason 'multilevel' is nothing to do with 'deep'. *But it does
  look a lot like neural networks.*

## Critic's choice

Seeing models adaptively regularize and avoid overfitting is magical.  Figure
10.1 is a delightful and unexpected drawing of a chimpanzee at a dining table.
