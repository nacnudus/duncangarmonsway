Given a distribution, how do you find the parameters?  When choosing a beta
prior for a Bayesian A/B test, for example.

What David Robinson is doing is best-practice for choosing a prior -- ask an
expert.  But he makes a huge leap from what the expert says to what the
parameters are.  Normally you'd use `dbeta(shape1, shape2)` to get the
distribution for given parameters, but here the problem is reversed: find the
parameters for a distribution with a mean of .270 and a cumulative density of,
say, .99 between .2 and .35.

How did David Robinson come up with the parameters 81 and 219?  There aren't
tools for that.  Perhaps he's brainy enough to do the maths in his head and
think, "Hmm, beta with mean = .270 and most of it between .2 and .35, in that
case 81 and 219 should be about right."  Or perhaps he just tried some numbers
and adjusted them until they worked.  There are online tools for that, or you
can use R.  For example, here's a beta distribution with an initial guess of the
parameters `shape1 = 2` and `shape2 = 4`).

<aside>
In [later posts](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical_bayes_baseball/) David
Robinson fits a beta prior to some data with `MASS::fitdistr()`, but I don't
have that luxury -- I have historical data, but it isn't stationary enough.  See
also several other methods in `?ebbr::ebb_fit_prior()` in David Robonson's [package](https://github.com/dgrtwo/ebbr).
</aside>

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 2, 4), from = 0, to = 1, type = "l")
```

Not quite right -- the parameters need adjusting. And it turns out to be fairly
straightforward to find parameters that get exactly the right mean by working
with the formula for the mean \(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}\).  The mean can
be interpreted as a number of successes divided by a number of attempts
(successes + failures), so a mean of .270 successes every 1 attempt is like 270
successes every 1000 attempts.  R's parameterisation of the beta distribution is
`shape1` successes and `shape2` failures, so a simple subtraction converts 270
successes and 100 attempts into (1000 - 270) failures.

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 270, (1000 - 270)), from = 0, to = 1, type = "l")
```

Now the distribution has correct mean, but the peak is too narrow -- most of it
lies above 0.25, whereas David Robinson only aimed for it to be above .2 and
below .35.  Unfortunately the cumulative density function is to complicated to
hack, but using a handy property -- smaller parameters make wider peaks -- let's
divide the parameters by a factor of, say, 3.

<aside>
The [cumulative density
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function#Incomplete_beta_function)
is a ratio of the *incomplete beta function* and the *beta function*

$$
I_x(a, b) = \frac{\mathrm{B}(x; a, b)}{\mathrm{B}(a, b)}
$$

where

$$
\mathrm{B}(x; a, b) = \int_{0}^{x} t^{a - 1} (1 - t)^{b - 1} dt \\
\mathrm{B}(a, b) = \int_{0}^{1} t^{a - 1} (1 - t)^{b - 1} dt
$$
</aside>

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 270 / 3, (1000 - 270) / 3), from = 0, to = 1, type = "l")
```

270 / 3 is 90 for \(\alpha\), and (1000 - 270) / 3  is about 243 for \(\beta\),
so this is in the ballpark of David Robinson's parameters 81 and 219, and we
could stop here.

**No don't stop!  Don't you see?  What just happened was tedious trial and
error; manual optimisation of the parameters to get the desired shape!  The
computer _used you as a labour-saving device_.  Give a taste of its own
medicine!  Make the computer do the trial and error with `optim()`!**

Here's a function that plugs various values of `shape1` and `shape2` into
`qbeta()` until it finds a curve with the properties we want: a mean of .270
and, say, 1% of the distribution to be below .2.

Effectively this re-parameterises the beta distribution to use "mean" and
"amount below x" instead of `shape1` "successes" and `shape2` "failures."  Call
it the _Gimme Beta_ for 'Gimme the beta I want'.  But because I ~~am lazy~~ have
a computer, instead of sweating over algebra to translate "mean" and "amount
below x" into `shape1` and `shape2`, I use `optim()` to find values of `shape1`
and `shape2` that create a distribution that _also satisifies_ my "mean" and
"amount below x".  And then I can use `shape1` and `shape2` to do the A/B test,
or whatever the prior is for.

$$
\mathrm{Gimme~Beta}(\mathrm{mean}, \mathrm{amount~below~}x) \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\mathrm{shape1}, \mathrm{shape2})
$$

```{r}
gimme_beta <- function(mean, cumulative_density, below, par_start = c(2, 2),
                       plot_from_to = NULL) {
  error <- function(x) {
    alpha1 <- x[1]
    beta1  <- x[2]
    fitted_mean <- alpha1 / (alpha1 + beta1)
    fitted_cumulative_density <- pbeta(below, alpha1, beta1)
    squared_diffs  <- sum((c(fitted_mean, fitted_cumulative_density )
                           - c(mean, cumulative_density))^2)
    squared_diffs
  }
  estimate <- optim(par_start, error)
  alpha1 = estimate$par[1]
  beta1 = estimate$par[2]
  if (is.null(plot_from_to)) {
    plot_from_to <- c(qbeta(0.00005, alpha1, beta1),
                      qbeta(0.99995, alpha1, beta1))
  }
  y <- curve(dbeta(x, alpha1, beta1),
             from = plot_from_to[1],
             to = plot_from_to[2],
             type = "l")
  c(shape1 = alpha1, shape2 = beta1)
}
```

<aside>
Note that the function doesn't allow three parameters, which is what David
Robinson kind of suggested.  We can only ask for the mean and that most of the
distribution is above a certain amount; we can't say that most of is between two
values, because that would be an extra, third parameter, and we're limited by
how many parameters the original beta distribution has.  Once the first two
parameters have been met, there's nothing left to move to meet a third
parameter.
</aside>

How well does `gimme_beta()` do on David Robinson's task?

```{r}
gimme_beta(mean = .270, cumulative_density = .01, below = .2)
```

That isn't far off the 81 and 219 that David Robinson came up with, but then we
don't know exactly what David Robinson meant by "lies almost entirely within".
What if we work out the \(\mu\) and \(\theta\) parameters of David Robinson's
actual distribution, plug them back into `gimme_beta()` and check again.

```{r}
81 / (81 + 219) # mu, the mean
pbeta(.2, 81, 219) # theta, the percentage of the distribution that is below 0.2
```

So plugging the (kinda) mean and the percentage-that-is-below-0.2 into
`gimme_beta()`, does it give us David Robinson's parameters back?

```{r}
gimme_beta(mean = .270, cumulative_density = .001897932, below = .2)
```

Close enough for government work.  And more importantly, `gimme_beta()` will
gimme the parameters I need for my A/B test, which happen to be a mean of .23
with 5% of the distribution below 0.2.

```{r}
gimme_beta(.23, .05, .2)
```
