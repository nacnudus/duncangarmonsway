This post does the following:

* Re-works the Financial Times poll-of-polls graph
* Explores the relationship between sample size, polling method, and voting
  intention.

## Data

I scraped the poll data from the [Financial Times poll of
polls](https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling).  The Financial Times made this
graph of it:

![https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling](brexit-ft-polls.png)

To check a later inference about sample sizes and online/telephone methods, I
also scraped polling data from the [BBC poll of
polls](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589) and used it
to augment the Financial Times data with the polling method.

My analysis focusses on the Financial Times data, because the sample sizes are
provided, there is a longer time-series, and I didn't notice the BBC's version
until I'd done most of the work.

```

## Reworking the graph

The Financial Times graph emphasises the poll-of-polls statistic, and the
difference between online and telephone polls.  In my version, I want to
emphasise the outcomes (the majority in each poll), the margins of the
majorities, and the sample sizes.  I also present the full series.

```{r brexit-timeseries1}
master_ft %>%
  filter(!is.na(sample_size)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, colour = majority)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(
                   ymax = max_percent, ymin = min_percent,
                   group = interaction(date, pollster),
                   linetype = sample_size), alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(aes(y = undecided, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha = .5) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 month", date_minor_breaks = "1 month",
               limits = c(ymd("2010-07-01"), NA),
               expand = c(0, 0), labels = date_format("%b %Y")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Majority/minority/undecided %") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Polls by date: Majority and its margin (lines), and undecided % (points)")
```

I would have included the poll-of-polls statistic on my graph, since the
Financial Times describes their method in a footnote:

> The FT poll of polls is calculated by taking the last seven polls from unique
> pollsters up to a given date, removing the two polls with the highest and
> lowest shares for 'remain', and calculating an adjusted average of the five
> remaining polls, where the more recent polls are given a higher weight

Unfortunately, besides omitting the weights, and their tie-breaking policy,
their statistic has obviously been redesigned since the footnote was written,
because their current statistic for 'remain' is higher than the second-highest
'remain' result in the last seven polls.

Here's that graph again, but this time beginning in September 2015 like the
Financial Times.

```{r brexit-timeseries2}
master_ft %>%
  filter(date >= ymd("2015-09-01")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, colour = majority)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(
                   ymax = max_percent, ymin = min_percent,
                   group = interaction(date, pollster),
                   linetype = sample_size), alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(aes(y = undecided, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha = .5) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", # Deleting this comment breaks 'make devserver'
               limits = c(ymd("2015-09-01"), NA),
               expand = c(0, 0), labels = date_format("%b %Y")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Majority/minority/undecided %") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Polls by date: Majority and its margin (lines), and undecided % (points)")
```

Something worth noticing is that the 'leave' majorities are mostly large
samples.  Comparing this graph with the one by the Financial Times, sample size
seems to be a proxy for telephone (small) vs online (large) polling methods.
Let's check.

Although the Financial Times graph distinguishes between online/telephone
methods, that information isn't included in the table, despite its obvious
[importance](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/23/commentary-what-explains-difference-between-phone-):

> There’s a big difference between the online and telephone polls on the EU
> referendum – with online polls showing the sides neck-and neck and telephone
> polls showing about a 15% gap in favour of ‘remain’. Why?

Fortunately, for most polls in the last six months, data from the [BBC's poll of
polls](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589) can augment
the Financial Times data with online/telephone information.  As the following
frequency table shows, in nearly all matched polls, large samples correspond
with an online method.  So while large samples appear to favour 'leave', it may
simply be that online polls do.

```{r brexit-frequency}
# Frequency table
table(master_both$sample_size, master_both$method, useNA = "always") %>% addmargins
```

However, telephone polls do not necessarily favour either side.  Comparing the
frequencies of outcomes with first methods and then sample sizes, the
association between small sample sizes and a 'remain' outcome appears to be much
stronger than between 'online' and 'remain' or 'phone' and 'remain'.  Perhaps
this is why the financial markets apparently regard telephone polls as more
reliable, despite the smaller sample sizes.

```{r brexit-frequency-outcome}
table(master_both$method, master_both$majority, useNA = "always") %>% addmargins
table(master_both$sample_size, master_both$majority, useNA = "always") %>% addmargins
```

## Outcome by sample size / polling method

I already noted that 'leave' majorities tend to come from large-sample/online
polls.  The next graph makes this more obvious.

```{r brexit-outcome-by-sample-size}
master_ft %>%
  ggplot(aes(majority, fill = majority)) +
  geom_bar() +
  annotate("text", "leave",  4, label = "Leave", colour = "white") +
  annotate("text", "remain",  4, label = "Remain", colour = "white") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of polls") +
  facet_wrap(~sample_size, labeller=labeller(sample_size = c("< 1400" = "Sample size < 1400", "≥ 1400" = "Sample size ≥ 1400"))) +
  ggtitle("Number of polls by majority") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Justification of large/small threshold

But how did I choose 1400 as the boundary between small and large samples?  It's
because of the following visualisations,  Polls with samples smaller than 1400
just seem to behave differently. Perhaps small samples don't find the 'leave'
voters, or perhaps they *do* find the 'remain' ones.

```{r brexit-remain-by-sample-size}
master_ft %>%
  filter(sample > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample, remain)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = majority, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1400, linetype = 2) +
  annotate("text", 1350, 0.24, hjust = 1, label = "1400") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b") +
  xlab("Sample size (log scale)") +
  ylab("Remain %") +
  ggtitle("Remain % vs sample size, by majority")
```

Smaller samples also don't find the undecided people (this is not quite as
convincing as the graph above).

```{r brexit-undecided-by-sample-size}
master_ft %>%
  filter(sample > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample, undecided)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = majority, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha =
             0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1400, linetype = 2) +
  annotate("text", 1350, 0.01, hjust = 1, label = "1400") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b") +
  xlab("Sample size (log scale)") +
  ylab("Undecided %") +
  ggtitle("Undecided % vs sample size, by majority")
```

Checking this against the method data from the BBC, I'm arguably on the right
track.  It would obviously be best to know the method as well as the sample
size, but since I'm using the Financial Times data, and since I don't have the
method of so many of those polls (grey points below), I have focussed on sample
size instead.

```{r brexit-method-vs-sample-size, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
master_ft %>%
  filter(sample > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample, remain)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = method, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha =
             0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1400, linetype = 2) +
  annotate("text", 1350, 0.24, hjust = 1, label = "1400") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#CC0033", "#0E6DCC"), na.value = "darkgrey", name = "Method") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#CC0033", "#0E6DCC"), na.value = "darkgrey", name = "Method") +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b") +
  xlab("Sample size (log scale)") +
  ylab("Remain %") +
  ggtitle("Remain % vs sample size, by method")

master_ft %>%
  filter(sample > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample, remain)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = method, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha =
             0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1400, linetype = 2) +
  annotate("text", 1350, 0.24, hjust = 1, label = "1400") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#CC0033", "#0E6DCC"), na.value = "darkgrey", name = "Method") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#CC0033", "#0E6DCC"), na.value = "darkgrey", name = "Method") +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b") +
  xlab("Sample size (log scale)") +
  ylab("Undecided %") +
  ggtitle("Undecided % vs sample size, by method")
```

## Indecision favours a 'leave' outcome: Part I -- graph

Here I can use stats, the only stats I've ever been taught (the really
out-of-date stuff), to explore whether undecided voters will favour the status
quo.  (What is my status quo, anyway -- that we're in Europe now, or that I've
always wanted to leave?)

Here's the association between indecision and the 'remain' vote.

```{r brexit-indecision-by-remain}
master_ft %>%
  ggplot(aes(undecided, remain)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = majority, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha = .5) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0.5, slope = -1/2, linetype = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  facet_wrap(~sample_size, labeller=labeller(sample_size = c("< 1400" = "Sample size < 1400", "≥ 1400" = "Sample size ≥ 1400"))) +
  xlab("Undecided %") +
  ylab("Remain %") +
  ggtitle("Remain % vs undecided %")
```

## Intermission (obvious glitch)

A few 'remain' majorities are below the 'win' threshold in the graph above
(green points below the dotted line).  That could be because of missing
"won't vote" information.  See YouGov's
[explanation](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/23/commentary-what-explains-difference-between-phone-):

> Telephone polls ask their respondents “How will you vote in the
> referendum?” People are assumed to have an opinion, and 90% of them give
> one. By contrast, online polls present people with options: remain, leave,
> won’t vote, don’t know – there is less assumption of an opinion, and 20% or
> more don’t offer one.

A few polls total much less than 100%, probably for the same reason, but it
isn't a problem in most cases.

```{r brexit-totals}
master_ft %>%
  mutate(total = remain + leave + undecided) %>%
  ggplot(aes(total)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#74736C") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent) +
  xlab("Remain + leave + undecided %") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of each poll's total (should be about 100%)")
```

## Indecision favours a 'leave' outcome: Part II -- stats
We've already seen the non-linearity of sample size vs everything, so I build
two models, first for large samples, then for small ones.

```{r breixit-lm_large}
lm_large <- lm(remain ~ undecided, data = master_ft %>% filter(sample_size == "≥ 1400"))
summary(lm_large)
```

The coefficient of 'undecided' is nearly -0.5, suggesting that undecided
large-sample voters about as likely to vote either way (lines almost parallel in
the graph below).  But as proportion of undecided voters reduces, at what point
does the 'remain' outcome start to benefit?  (this analysis will be more
meaningful for small samples, in just a moment).

There are two linear functions: the fitted model, and the threshold of a
majority (depending on the proportion of voters who are undecided).  Not only
can we plot these functions (and base R is simplest here), but we can solve
them for the fulcrum, which turns out to be about 19%.  If the proportion of
voters who are undecided is below 19%, then outcome is likely to be 'remain'.

I exhibit the R code here, for anyone interested in plotting functions and
solving them.

```{r brexit-fulcrum-large, echo = TRUE}
remain <- function(x) {coef(lm_large)[2] * x + coef(lm_large)[1]}
majority <- function(x) {(1 - x) / 2}
plot(remain, 0, 0.5, xlab = "undecided", col = "blue")
plot(majority, 0, 0.5, col = "brown", add = TRUE)
fulcrum <- function(x) {remain(x) - majority(x)}
uniroot(fulcrum, interval = c(0, 1))$root
master_ft %>% filter(sample_size == "≥ 1400", undecided >= 0.1855785) %>% nrow
```

Since "small" may be a proxy for "online", let's model that, too.

```{r brexit-lm-small}
lm_small <- lm(remain ~ undecided, data = master_ft %>% filter(sample_size == "< 1400"))
summary(lm_small)
```

This time, the coefficient of undecided is about -0.8, suggesting that
undecided small-sample voters are more likely to vote to remain.  The fulrum,
now much more meaningful than above, given the coefficient, is at about 26%,
with a caveat that there are only five observations above 26%.

```{r brexit-fulcrum-small, echo = TRUE}
remain <- function(x) {coef(lm_small)[2] * x + coef(lm_small)[1]}
majority <- function(x) {(1 - x) / 2}
plot(remain, 0, 0.5, xlab = "undecided", col = "blue")
plot(majority, 0, 0.5, col = "brown", add = TRUE)
fulcrum <- function(x) {remain(x) - majority(x)}
uniroot(fulcrum, interval = c(0, 1))$root
master_ft %>% filter(sample_size == "< 1400", undecided >= 0.255461) %>% nrow
```

## Zero undecided voters

Finally, what about the five zero-undecided polls (the five points along the
bottom of the timeseries)?  It turns out that those polls were all conducted by
the ORB company, and they're also the large-sample polls by ORB.  They aren't
included in the BBC data, so we can't tell whether or not they are online polls.
Make of them what you will.

```{r brexit-zero-undecided}
master_ft %>% filter(undecided == 0)
master_ft %>%
  filter(pollster == "ORB") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, undecided)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = majority, shape = sample_size), stroke = 0.8, alpha = .5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", labels = date_format("%b %Y")) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Undecided %") +
  ggtitle("ORB polls: sample size vs undecided % by date")
```
