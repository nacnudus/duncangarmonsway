## Reading week

This week I am reading [Statistical
Rethinking](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-Stan/McElreath/p/book/9781482253443)
by Richard McElreath.  Each day I post my prior beliefs about Bayesian
Statistics, read a bit, and update them.  See also [Day
1](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/posts/2019-02-18-rebel-bayes-day-1/),
[Day
2](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/posts/2019-02-19-rebel-bayes-day-2/),
[Day
3](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/posts/2019-02-20-rebel-bayes-day-3/)
and [Day
4](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/posts/2019-02-21-rebel-bayes-day-4/).

## Prior beliefs

* It's not right for two predictors to covary. Only a predictor and an outcome
  ought to covary. Ideally in perfect unison. As nature intended.
* When each category has its own linear model, you can vary the intercept, or
  the slope, or both, and you can also either partially pool or not pool at all
  (fully pooling means they all get the same model). This totally isn't
  *p*-hacking nor is it (shudder) *deep learning*.
* There is no data so big that you can't make it too small by (over-)fitting
  too complex a model.
* 'Continuous categories' is probably clickbait.
* Missing data is fundamentally the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night
  Time. You guess what wasn't observed by what ought to have been observed.
* Measurement error correction is this [Dilbert cartoon strip about averaging
  two wrong databases](https://dilbert.com/strip/2008-05-07).

## New data

### 13. Adventures in Covariance

* "[The robot] likewise learns more information about slopes when it also pools
  information about slopes.  And the pooling is achieved in the same way, by
  estimating the population distribution of slopes at the same time the robot
  estimates each slope."
* "Any batch of parameters with *exchangeable* parameters can and probably
  should be pooled."
* "This covariation is information that the robot can use. If we can figure out
  a way to pool information *across* parameter types -- intercepts and slopes"
* "Sometimes, the pattern of variation in slopes provides hints about omitted
  variables"
* "if it suddenly seems both conceptually and computationally much more
  difficult, that only means you are paying attention."

#### 13.1 Varying slopes by construction

* "there aren't very many multivariate distributions that are easy to work with.
  The only common ones are multivariate Gaussian and multivariate Student (or 't') distributions."
* "lack of balance can really favor the varying effects analysis, because
  partial pooling uses information about the population where it is needed most."
* "we are always forced to analyze data with a model that is misspecified."
* "In a Bayesian model, a likelihood is merely a prior for the data, and
  inference about parameters can be shockingly insensitive to its details."
* "You can think of [LKJcorr(2)] as a regularizing prior for correlations."
* "shrinkage on the parameter scale naturally produces shrinkage where we
  actually care about it: on the outcome scale."
* "instead of being alarmed, feel the warm glow that comes form knowing that
  Stan is looking out for you."

#### 13.2 Example: Admission decisions and gender

* "Just because a marginal posterior overlaps zero does not mean we should think
  of it as zero."

#### 13.3 Example: Cross-classified chimpanzees with varying slopes

* "Mathematically, these alternative parameterizations are equivalent, but
  inside the MCMC engine they are not."
* "Both models arrive at equivalent inferences, but the non-centered version
  samples much more efficiently."
* "It's often more useful to understand the data through the consilience of
  multiple models than to try to find any one true model."

#### 13.4 Continuous categories and the Gaussian process

* "Individuals of similar ages should have more similar intercepts."
* "This name [Gaussian Process Regression] is unfortunately wholly uninformative
  about what it is for and how it works."
* "What the model does is estimate a function for the covariance between pairs
  of cases at different distances."
* "Why square the distance? ... it is easy to fit to data and has the
  often-realistic property of allowing covariance to decline more quickly as
  the distance grows." *The graph shows that it declines more *slowly* to begin
  with, then more quickly.*
* "The function $\delta_{ij}$ is equal to 1 when $i = j$ but is zero otherwise."
* "We'll define priors for the square of each, and estimate them on the same
  scale, because that's computationally easier."
* "A little knowledge of Pacific navigation would probably allow us a smart,
  informative prior on [the rate of decline of covariance by distance] at least."
* "I know, this is rather meta"
* "it is the entire distribution that matters. No single point within it is
  special."
* "network distance is another type of abstract distance that can be plugged
  into these models."
* "Building fancier Gaussian process models like the ones described just above
  is best done directly in Stan's modeling language"

### 14. Missing Data and Other Opportunities

* "A big advantage of Bayesian inference is that it obviates the need to be
  clever."
* "the real trick of the Bayesian approach: to apply conditional probability in
  all places, for data and parameters."
* "revealing the implications of the assumptions, in light of the evidence."

#### 14.1 Measurement error

* "the fully Bayesian approach: Information flows among the measurements to
  provide improved estimates of the data itself."
* "Bayesian models are *generative*, meaning they can be used to simulate
  observations just as well as they can be used to estimate parameters."
* "typical 'data' is just a special case of a probability distribution for which
  all of the mass is piled up on a single value."
* "If this isn't intuitive to you -- because you are normal ..."
* "we don't have any additional information here, so Gaussian it is."
* "it's fine to replace a predictor variable with a probability distribution."
* "Ignoring measurement error tends to exaggerate associations between outcomes
  and predictors."
* "Do not average.  Instead, model."

#### 14.2 Missing data

* "[Missing Completely At Random] is also the assumption that is required for
  dropping the cases with missing values to make sense."
* "The joint information then makes the intuitively impossible -- inferring
  missing data -- a matter of deduction."

### 15. Horoscopes

* "Why pay attention to breathlessly announced new discoveries, when as many as
  half of them will turn out to be false?"
* "it's entirely possible for most findings at any one point in time to be
  false but for science in the long term to still function."
* "Poor signal will not mean no findings, just unreliable ones."
* "We agonize over bias and measurement and statistical analysis, but then allow
  it all back in during publication."
* "The data and its analysis are the scientific product.  The paper is just an
  advertisement."
* "mathematical foundations solve few, if any, of the contingent problems that
  we confront in the context of a study."

## Updated beliefs

* ✕ It's not right for two predictors to covary. Only a predictor and an outcome
  ought to covary. Ideally in perfect unison. As nature intended.  *Obviously
  predictors do covary, which weakens their predictive power, but on the other
  hand if any predictors are missing then you can use covariance to deduce what
  they ought to have been.*
* ✓ When each category has its own linear model, you can vary the intercept, or
  the slope, or both, and you can also either partially pool or not pool at all
  (fully pooling means they all get the same model). This totally isn't
  *p*-hacking nor is it (shudder) *deep learning*. *I mean, it's basically deep
  learning.  Learning the priors from the data.  Come on.*
* ✓ There is no data so big that you can't make it too small by (over-)fitting
  too complex a model.
* ✓ 'Continuous categories' is probably clickbait. *Pants-on-fire clickbait.
  It's a linear relationship between a continuous variable and a parameter.*
* ✓ Missing data is fundamentally the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night
  Time. You guess what wasn't observed by what ought to have been observed.
* ✕ Measurement error correction is this [Dilbert cartoon strip about averaging
  two wrong databases](https://dilbert.com/strip/2008-05-07). *So, so wrong.
  Average, do not.  Model, instead.*

## Critic's Choice

Imputed distributions of missing data points.  There can't be a more intuitive
way to present how imputation works.

I'm concerned that the optimisations for the sake of computation smack of
the art of writing performant SQL queries.  It becomes the thing you spend most
of your time doing.
