This post does three things:

* Finds out how many R-related blogs there are *really* (not a well-defined
  question).
* Shows that I can use semi-structured non-csv data (job interview weakness).
* Explains where all the time goes.

Many people who promote R quote the number of R blogs as given on the
[R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) website by Tal Galili, which syndicates
literally hundreds of R-related blogs (573 at the time of writing).  But the
number tends only to increase.  How many actual posts are there in a given
week/month, from how many different blogs?

## Update 30 April 2016

I have a longer history of daily digest emails than I thought.  The data, and
some of the text, has been updated to go back to October 2013.

## The gist of it

I subscribed to the [R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) daily digest emails
in early 2014, giving me a good time-series of posts.

The initial dump is easy from Gmail (define a filter > use it to apply a
new label > request a dump of the labelled emails).  Since the dump is in a
single plain-text file, and because the amazing R-community has bothered to
generalise so many solutions to fiddly problems by making packages, all the
remaining steps are also easy.

1. Separate the emails into individual files, using `convert_mbox_eml` in the
   `tm.plugin.mail` package.
2. Parse the date-time in the first line of each file, using base R (hooray for
   base!)
3. Parse the HTML email content using `read_html` in the `xml2` package (which
   has its own magic to trim off the non-HTML email headers).
4. Extract the names of the blogs in each email using an XPath string created by
   the *SelectorGadget* browser extension/bookmarklet.
5. Mung and analyse the data.

## The answer

It turns out that there are about 75 blogs active in a given month, posting
about 160 posts (Revolutions is the only one that regularly posts more than once
per week).  Nothing much has changed in the last year.  For some arbitrary
definition of "dead blog", a survival analysis could be done.

## What took me so long

This was an easy project, but a few quirks soaked up a lot of time:

* I wanted to initialise an empty list, to store information collected by
  looping through the emails.  This is one of my favourite R idiosyncracies.
  Consider how the following function could be any less intuitive: `empty_list
  <- vector(mode = "list", length = n)`.  I usually don't think of lists as a
  kind of vector, and usually think of them as a class rather than a mode, but
  perhaps that's just me.
* Gmail filters and labels *conversations*, rather than individual emails, so
  the occasional forward of an R-Bloggers digest scuppered the code.
* One of the digests had a glitch -- no links to the originial blogs.  The date
  is given in a non-`lubridate`-friendly order, so I had to rediscover
  `strptime`.
* Some blog names include unusual characters that appear in the plain text in a
  funny way (e.g. "=E2=80=A6").  These had to be found-and-replaced (using
  `stringr`).
* While, `xml_find_all` in the `xml2` package understands
* `3D\"itemcontentlist\"` as part of an XPath string, I intially fell foul of
  `html_nodes` in the `rvest` package, which doesn't seem to understand it as
  part of a CSS string.
* Given a named list, how can you crate a data frame that links the names to the
  each element of the vectors?  Finding this kind of thing out is entirely a
  game of Google Search Term Bingo, but in this case I used part of a clever
  [StackOverflow solution](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16326629/937932) of a
  different problem.  To save you digging around in the `purrr` or `rlist`
  packages, the answer is `stack` in (hooray!) `base`.

But the biggest time-sucker by far was the bizarre way that the plain text of
the emails had been trimmed to 76 characters, by sticking an equals sign and a
Windows-style line-ending (carriage return and line feed, i.e. `\r\n`) after the
75th character.  This is snag-tastic, because it's hard to find a tool that will
both search-and-replace across line-endings, and also search-and-replace
multiple characters.  `sed` is one of those command-line tools that lurks for
years before pouncing, and this was its moment, when I finally had to learn a
bit more than merely `s/pattern/replacement/g`.  [This StackOverflow
answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7697604/937932) explains how the following
command works: `sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/=\r\n//g' dirty.mbox > clean.mbox`.

## Reward

Thankyou for reading. Here are some more graphs, and some code fragments.

```{r rbloggers-top10, echo = FALSE}
# Most prolific bloggers
blogs %>%
  count(blog) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  mutate(blog = factor(blog, levels = blog)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(blog, n, label = blog)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of posts since October 2013") +
  ggtitle("Top-10 bloggers by number of posts since October 2013") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r rbloggers-rates, echo = FALSE}
# Rates of blogging (smoothed difference in days)

# A problem: If the smoother smooths to zeroes or negative values, then the log
# transform won't work.  Here, I don't think there will ever be zeroes, so I can
# use the first suggestion here:
# http://stackoverflow.com/a/2782383/937932
# Which smooths on the logged values (which guarantees being above zero), but
# plots on the exponentiated logged values (equivalent to the original).

# The log transformation displays widely disparate rates on one scale, and the
# fuss about log(7) is to get the axis to be labelled in one-week and four-week
# bits.

# The bug was hard to pin down, because it didn't apply consistently to any
# given blog when that blog was removed from the data, and that's because the
# smoothing function was applied *before* facetting (and again afterward), so
# removing certain blogs affected the smoothing of the remaining blogs, which
# meant that the blogs that were to blame on their own were able to hide among
# the others.
